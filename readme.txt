Audit Trail is a plugin to keep track of what is going on inside your blog by monitoring administration functions.

== Description ==

Audit Trail is a plugin to keep track of what is going on inside your blog. It does this by recording certain actions (such as who logged in and when) and storing this information in the form of a log. Not only that but it records the full contents of posts (and pages) and allows you to restore a post to a previous version at any time.

To summarise:

* Log of user actions inside your blog - useful for finding out who did what in a multi-user system
* Extensible, allowing other plugins the ability to add and display items in the Audit Trail
* Ability to track registered user page visits
* Fully localized

Audit Trail is available in:

* English
* Estonian by Lembit Kivisik
* Belorussian by Marcis G
* Simplified Chinese by maoanyuan
* German by Andreas Beraz
* Japanese by Chestnut
* Romanian by Mikalay Lisica
* Lithuanian by Nata Strazda

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install:

1. Download `audit-trail.zip`
1. Unzip
1. Upload `audit-trail` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Go to the plugin management page and enable the plugin
